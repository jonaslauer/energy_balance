# energy_balance
Project to forecast the energy balance between Germany and surrounding countries.

Steps to generate the forecasts:

1. Receive Load, Generation and Balance data from ENTSOE
   - Depth of spatial detail still open
   - For generation the focus is on wind and solar power
   - Balance data will be loaded for all involved countries
2. Visualize data from the past
3. Try ML approaches to forecast the balances based on Wind and Solar Power forecasts
